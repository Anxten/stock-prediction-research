A Time-Series Forecasting project utilizing **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks to predict the daily closing price of **Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI.JK)** stocks. Built with PyTorch.

## 📌 Project Overview
Predicting stock market trends is challenging due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial data. This project implements a Deep Learning approach using a Stacked LSTM architecture to capture temporal dependencies in historical stock prices.

The model is trained on historical data (fetched via Yahoo Finance) and is capable of:
1.  Analyzing trends from the past 60 days.
2.  Predicting the closing price for the next trading day (H+1).

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The core of this project is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) specialized for sequence prediction:
* **Input:** 60-day sliding window of Normalized Closing Prices.
* **Hidden Layers:** 2 Stacked LSTM Layers (50 units each).
* **Output Layer:** Fully Connected (Linear) Layer.
* **Optimizer:** Adam (`lr=0.001`).
* **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE).
